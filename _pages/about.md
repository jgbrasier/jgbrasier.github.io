I am a graduate student at the [Institude for Applied Computational Science](https://iacs.seas.harvard.edu/) at Harvard where I am concentrating in Data Science. Prior to this, I graduated from ESPCI Paris with a Masters of Engineering in Physics.

I am currently a Graduate Research Fellow at the [Zitnik Lab](https://zitniklab.hms.harvard.edu/) within the Department of Biomedical Informatics at Harvard Medical School. My research focus is on applying geometric deep learning methods for predicting TCR-pMHC bindings. 

My general interests lie at the intersection of deep learning, graphs and their applications to biology or physical sciences.
